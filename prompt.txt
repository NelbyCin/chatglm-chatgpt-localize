你见过穿上身就能发光发电的纤维吗？关于智能可穿戴设备，你期待它们能带来哪些神奇的功能？
4月5日，东华大学材料科学与工程学院先进功能材料课题组，在《科学》上发表了一项令人瞩目的研究成果。
该研究提出了基于“人体耦合”的能量交互机制，并成功研发出集无线能量采集、信息感知与传输等功能于一体的新型智能纤维。用这种纤维编织制成的智能纺织品，无需依赖芯片和电池便可实现发光显示、触控等人机交互功能。
这一突破性成果，为人与环境的智能交互开辟了新可能，具有广泛应用前景。
智能可穿戴设备正逐渐成为人们生活的一部分。目前，智能纤维的开发多基于“冯·诺依曼架构”，这意味着智能纺织品仍依赖于芯片和电池。这使产品的体积、重量和刚性大，难以同时满足人们对纺织品功能性和舒适性的需求。
东华大学科研团队开创性地提出了“非冯·诺伊曼架构”的新型智能纤维，有效地简化了可穿戴设备和智能纺织品的硬件结构，优化了其可穿戴性。
该研究实现了将能量采集、信息感知、信号传输等功能集成于单根纤维中，并通过编织制成不依赖芯片和电池的智能纺织品。
“不插电”就能发光发电的纤维，到底有什么奥妙？在日常生活中，散布在环境中的电磁能量又是如何“传递”到纤维上的？
该研究提出把人体作为能量交互的载体，开辟了一条便捷的能量“通道”。原本在大气中耗散的电磁能量优先进入纤维、人体、大地组成的回路，恰恰就是这一“日用而不觉”的原理，促成了“人体耦合”的新型能量交互机制。
在添加特定功能材料后，仅仅经过人体触碰，这种新型纤维就会展现发光发电的“神奇一幕”。
“这款新型纤维具有三层鞘芯结构，所采用的均是市面上比较常见的原材料。芯层为感应交变电磁场的纤维天线（镀银尼龙纤维）、中间层为提高电磁能量耦合容量的介电层、外层为电场敏感的发光层。原材料成本低，纤维和织物的加工都能够用成熟的工艺实现，已具备量产能力。”论文第一作者、东华大学材料科学与工程学院博士研究生杨伟峰说。
该研究还展示了这种基于人体耦合原理的智能纤维的几种应用：在不使用芯片和电池的情况下，实现了纤维触控发光、织物显示以及无线指令传输等功能。
东华大学纤维材料改性国家重点实验室研究员侯成义介绍：“这种新型纤维能够运用到服装服饰、布艺装饰等日用纺织品中。当与人体接触时，它会通过发光进行可视化的传感、交互甚至高亮照明，同时还能对人体的不同姿态动作产生无线信号，进而对智能家电等电子产品进行无线遥控。这些新颖的功能有望拓展电子产品的应用场景，甚至改变人们智慧生活的方式。”
课题组组长王宏志教授表示，未来将深入研究如何让这种新型纤维能够更有效地从空间中收集能量，并以此驱动更多功能，包括显示、变形、运算、人工智能等。

随着春季气温上升，人体皮脂分泌量增加，不少脸上爱“出油”的年轻人频频“爆痘”，苦恼不堪。中医专家提示，对于痤疮这种皮肤顽疾，中西医结合、内外合治具有一定优势，患者日常也要从饮食、作息等方面加强预防。
中国中医科学院西苑医院皮肤科副主任医师佘远遥介绍，痤疮是一种发生于毛囊和皮脂腺的慢性炎症，过度分泌的皮脂与灰尘、老化角质细胞混合，容易堵塞毛孔，表现为粉刺、丘疹、脓疱、结节等多种形式，反复发作。其发病主要和不良情绪、作息不规律、大便不通畅等因素有关。此外，皮肤经常过敏的人群因皮肤敏感脆弱，皮肤屏障功能下降，也相对容易感染痤疮丙酸杆菌而出现痤疮。
“痤疮完全可控可治，但通常至少需要两三个月时间。”佘远遥说，通过内服中药、西药并结合外用药物、中医针灸、光电治疗这样的中西医结合治疗方式，坚持足疗程治疗通常会有较好的效果，患者要有耐心和信心。
那么，什么样的痤疮患者需要治疗？佘远遥说，如果仅出现两三颗“青春痘”尤其是以粉刺为主，可以不用治疗，但“痘痘”长得较多或较重，或者出现大的结节、囊肿，则需要系统规范治疗。
佘远遥介绍，具体而言，粉刺如果不多，可以外治法为主，比如在患处涂抹维甲酸类药物，或进行中药“清痘”、中医针灸治疗。如果出现炎性丘疹甚至伴有脓疱结节，建议在外治基础上增加一些中药或西药的口服药，其中，口服中药治疗采取辨证论治、一人一方的个体化治疗方式，即根据症状、舌象、脉象来制定个性化的治疗方案，如清肺胃湿热、活血化瘀、调理冲任等。
担心“冒痘”降低“颜值”，生活中该如何预防？中国中医科学院西苑医院皮肤科住院医师张益生建议，每日认真清洁面部，规律作息，保持大便通畅，注意防晒，同时，饮食上要少吃高糖高脂和辛辣食物及曾经导致“冒痘”的食物。（记者田晓航）

In 2012 an Irish parliamentary committee hearing had degenerated into a raucous shouting match when a voice cut through the mayhem. “Chillax,” said Simon Harris. “I think everyone needs to take a step back here.”
The 25-year-old legislator’s intervention silenced and mystified his colleagues. One wondered if chillax was Latin. Use of the word made headlines. “All the young people know what ‘chillax’ is,” Harris told the Dáil the next day.
He showed little sign of chilling or relaxing himself, however, and instead became a political vortex who 12 years later is poised to become Ireland’s youngest prime minister. His social media skills have prompted a nickname, the “TikTok taoiseach”.
On 9 April the Dáil is expected to confirm Harris, 37, as successor to Leo Varadkar, who stunned the country last month when he announced his resignation as prime minister and leader of Fine Gael.
The higher education minister blitzed potential rivals to be coronated as the party’s new leader. Fine Gael’s coalition partners, Fianna Fáil and the Greens, back him to become taoiseach.
It will be the culmination of a precocious rise for a polished communicator who has rewritten the political rulebook in Ireland but is barely known in Belfast, London or Brussels.
“At this stage there is more interest in why Leo left than who is Simon Harris but that will very quickly turn to who is Simon,” said Frances Fitzgerald, a Fine Gael MEP and former minister who mentored Harris at the start of his career.
The new taoiseach will face daunting challenges. A housing crisis and fraying public services dim the centre-right coalition’s hopes of winning an election due by next March. Farmers are chafing at environmental rules while climate activists lament missed targets. Post-Brexit relations with London are tetchy and Northern Ireland’s government is fragile. About a third of Fine Gael’s Dáil deputies are stepping down rather than face voters.
Yet Harris has reputedly yearned for this opportunity since he was a teenager. “He’s acutely and almost obsessionally ambitious,” said Shane Ross, a former Fine Gael and independent politician who served in cabinet with Harris and knew him as a newly elected legislator in 2011. “He was always in a hurry, even at that time. Very early on he declared his leadership ambitions.”
Harris has humble roots. He grew up in Greystones, a County Wicklow coastal town south of Dublin, the son of a taxi driver and a school special needs assistant, and attended St Joseph’s, a community school.
He was a keen debater and wrote a play at 13, said Neale Richmond, a junior minister who has known Harris for 20 years. “The work ethic comes from his parents, they’re work, work, work.”
Having a younger brother with Asperger syndrome prompted the 15-year-old Harris to lobby politicians for autism services, instilling a passion for public service, said Richmond. “Simon is very good craic and obsessed with politics. Always in a rush, he walks very quickly and talks very quickly. It’s all about what you can do as quickly as possible.”

Dotted along the length of Britain’s rivers are various obstacles – some as large as dams, others as small as weirs (which bisect a river like steps) – stopping creatures, sediment and plants from moving along the watercourse. Only 1% of the UK’s rivers are free of artificial barriers.
Moves are under way in many countries to remove such obstacles and let rivers “re-naturalise” and follow their own paths. But while many scientists agree that river barriers need to go in the UK too, other people are hesitant – concerned about creating unpredictable water flows in already flood-prone regions.
“Our rivers and our lakes are the most damaged of all ecosystems,” says Paul Kemp, a professor of ecological engineering at the University of Southampton. Globally, freshwater ecosystems are home to about a third of the planet’s vertebrate species, and these have been declining at twice the rate of marine and land-based animals. The situation in England is dire, with about 15% of rivers achieving good ecological status, according to the Rivers Trust.
Removing barriers “results in the greatest impact the most rapidly and for the least amount of money,” says Kemp.
In England, there are more than 50,000 barriers disrupting the passage of the country’s beleaguered rivers, according to the Environment Agency database. Scientists within the organisation suspect that there are many more. The overwhelming majority of these are relatively small: about 27,500 culverts, usually round concrete pipes, and around 16,300 weirs, which adjust the water level and effectively create a small dam.
These barriers are not only costly to maintain – they also cause avoidable environmental damage.
“A few decades ago, we thought only migratory species needed to move,” says Dr Perikles Karageorgopoulos, a senior technical specialist at the Environment Agency. “But we increasingly understand that all species need to move, from the tiniest ones that will have local migrations through to the others that migrate for many kilometres to overwinter or reach their spawning grounds.” Having so many barriers effectively creates a network of small dams or lakes, which offer plants and animals very different habitats from those found in free-flowing rivers, and are often not appropriate for river species.
